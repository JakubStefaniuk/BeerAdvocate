Which brewery produces the strongest beers by abv?
- Brewery Schorschbräu produces highest adv beers on average; 19.23%
- Strongest beer is produced by Schorschbräu brewery and its abv is 57.7%

What are the factors that impact the quality of beer the most?
It is assumed, that beer quality is based on overall reviews*.
- Factor: review_taste impacts beer quality, having: 0.79 influence (Pearson's coefficient)
- Factor: review_palate impacts beer quality, having: 0.7 influence (Pearson's coefficient)
- Factor: review_aroma impacts beer quality, having: 0.62 influence (Pearson's coefficient)

To sum it up: taste, palate and aroma are the 3 most influencing beer's quality factors.
What surprised me is that beer style and brewery choice barely showed any correlation, at first I thought that
beers from the best known breweries will be drastically better than the others.

* NOTE:
Only these factors are taken into account:
- beer_abv
- beer_style
- appearance_review
- palate_review
- taste_review
- aroma_review
- brewery_id

Below factors are being excluded from impacting beer quality:
- brewery_name (redundancy, as brewery_id is already included)
- review_time (obvious)
- review_overall (our target quality variable)
- review_profilename (obvious)
- beer_name (as it definitely impacts overall_review, as review is for specific beer)
- beer_beerid (=,=)
